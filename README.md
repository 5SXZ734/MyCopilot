# MyCopilot

A lightweight C++ speech-to-text assistant prototype.

This project (currently in early development) implements basic speech processing capabilities in C++ using CMake. The goal is to build a simple “Copilot-style” tool that can convert audio input into text and act as a foundation for future assistant-type features.

## 🧠 Features

✔ Command-line C++ application  
✔ Speech input processing (speech-to-text)  
✔ Modular architecture with worker threads  
✔ Build support via CMake

> *More features like real-time audio capture and AI integration can be added later.*

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before building, make sure you have:

- A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, MSVC)
- CMake (minimum version 3.10)
- A terminal/console environment
- Optional: audio capture library (e.g., PortAudio) if extending real-time input support
